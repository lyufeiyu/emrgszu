### Abstract  
In machine learning or data mining tasks, high-dimensional data analysis is receiving increasing attention. Due to the presence of irrelevant or redundant features, classification accuracy often drops significantly. Feature Selection (FS) aims to improve predictive performance by selecting an optimal feature subset and plays a crucial role in this context. This paper proposes an improved discretization-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method for FS. In our method, a moderate pre-filtering step is first applied to obtain a reduced feature set. Then, a sorted cut-point table is constructed, which stores multiple cut points ordered by entropy-based priority. A simple yet effective encoding/decoding method is used within PSO to flexibly select the number of cut points that best distinguish the data. Furthermore, a probability-guided local search strategy is adopted to explore better combinations of cut points for promising feature subsets. Extensive experiments on 19 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements and show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art PSO-based competitors.
