
Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that integrates principles from evolutionary algorithms and machine learning. At its core, EML mimics the process of natural selectionâ€”using population-based operations such as selection, crossover, and mutationâ€”to iteratively optimize candidate solutions. This enables the construction of intelligent systems that can adapt and improve performance over time. EML is particularly effective in tackling complex optimization and learning tasks where traditional approaches may struggle, such as feature selection, robotic path planning, and multi-objective optimization.
