Human Activity Recognition is a key branch of computer vision that aims to understand and classify human behaviors from video or sensor data. It covers a wide range of tasks such as detecting walking, running, jumping, etc., and is widely applied in:

- Intelligent surveillance systems  
- Human-computer interaction (HCI)  
- Sports motion analysis  
- Video-based behavior monitoring systems  

By analyzing motion features across the temporal dimension, HAR provides essential support for intelligent video understanding and behavioral reasoning.
