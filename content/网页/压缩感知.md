Compressed Sensing (CS) is an advanced signal processing technique that enables efficient compression and accurate reconstruction of signals. It is based on the observation that many real-world signals are inherently sparse or can be represented using only a few significant coefficients. By capturing far fewer measurements than traditional sampling methods, CS allows for effective recovery of the original signal.

Applications of compressed sensing include:

- Image and video compression  
- Medical imaging (e.g., MRI)  
- Efficient data transmission in wireless communication  

Compressed sensing is critical for improving acquisition speed, reducing transmission bandwidth, and enhancing overall system efficiency.
